# Quick Start Guide

## Getting Started with Your Research

### Step 1: Set Up Your Notion Database
1. Open Notion and create a new page
2. Choose "Table" database type
3. Use `/templates/data_schema.json` to set up all fields
4. Follow `/docs/notion_setup.md` for detailed configuration

### Step 2: Begin with One Nation
Start with a well-documented nation to familiarize yourself with the process:
- **Suggested:** Cowichan Tribes (largest First Nation in BC)
- **Website:** https://cowichantribes.com/

### Step 3: Use the Nation Profile Template
1. Copy `/templates/nation_profile.md`
2. Create new file: `/research/nations/cowichan_tribes.md`
3. Fill in information as you research
4. Track your work in `/templates/research_log.md`

### Step 4: Follow the Research Process

#### For Each Nation:
1. **Check Official Website First**
   - Look for: About Us, Governance, Contact, History
   - Save screenshots of important pages

2. **Verify with Government Database**
   - Go to: https://fnp-ppn.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/
   - Search for the First Nation
   - Cross-reference information

3. **Add to Notion Database**
   - Create new entry
   - Fill in verified information
   - Add sources with dates
   - Set status to "In Progress"

4. **Document Your Work**
   - Update research log
   - Note any questions or gaps
   - Save copies of sources

### Step 5: Systematic Approach

#### Week 1-2: Coast Salish Nations
- Start with WSÁNEĆ (Saanich) Nations
- Move to Cowichan Valley nations
- Complete southern Vancouver Island

#### Week 3-4: Nuu-chah-nulth Nations
- Begin with Nuu-chah-nulth Tribal Council members
- Work north along west coast

   - Save all sources

3. **Data Entry** (20-30 min)
   - Add to Notion database
   - Update statuses
   - Cross-check entries

4. **End Session** (10 min)
   - Update research log
   - Note follow-up items
   - Plan next session

### Tips for Success

1. **Be Systematic**
   - Work through regions methodically
   - Don't jump around randomly
   - Complete profiles before moving on

2. **Stay Organized**
   - Use consistent file naming
