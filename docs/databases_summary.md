# Indigenous Peoples Databases Summary

## Overview
This project now contains two comprehensive databases documenting Indigenous peoples:
1. **Vancouver Island First Nations** (Canada)
2. **New Zealand Māori Iwi** (Aotearoa)

## Database Links
- **Vancouver Island First Nations**: https://www.notion.so/244c6f799a33814ca939e50e5260e8f7
- **New Zealand Māori Iwi**: https://www.notion.so/244c6f799a3381a9a757f86ab90ec3f6

## Database Comparison

- **New Zealand**: Te reo Māori with dialect variations

### Territory
- **Canada**: Reserve lands and traditional territories
- **New Zealand**: Rohe (tribal boundaries) and Treaty settlement areas

## Next Steps

### For Vancouver Island Database:
1. Complete data entry for remaining ~35 First Nations
2. Verify all official websites and contacts
3. Add population data from 2021 census
4. Document treaty details
5. Create relationship mappings between nations

### For New Zealand Database:
1. Add remaining major iwi (~50-60)
2. Include hapū information where appropriate
3. Add Treaty settlement details
4. Include iwi radio stations and media
5. Add economic entity information
6. Create pepeha templates for each iwi

### Common Tasks:
1. Set up regular verification schedule
2. Create data quality checks
3. Develop user guides for each database
4. Establish update protocols
5. Create export/backup procedures

## Ethical Considerations
Both databases follow principles of Indigenous data sovereignty:
- Only public information included
- Respect for cultural protocols
- Regular verification with official sources
- No private genealogical information
- Focus on educational purposes
